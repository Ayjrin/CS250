Software Development Lifecycle


 - How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   - Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program requires understanding the problem from the user's perspective, then translating that into clear requirements that guide development. Creating user stories helps by capturing specific, goal oriented scenarios that define how the user will interact with the software, making sure there is alignment between user expectations and the technical solution.
 - How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   - I approach developing programs by asking questions first. Understanding the problem thoroughly save me a lot of time as I build the tool. I can build the tool right, but first asking questions and understanding user needs help me build the right tool. I use Jira boards in my work and will be implementing more formal agile concepts in a couple of personal projects as well.
 - What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   - being a good team member can mean a lot of things and it's not limited to software development; being helpful, open to learning, hard working, just to name a few. Knowing technical skills, while necessary, are not the primary things I look for in a team member. I look for someone who can teach me and walk me through things they know and I don't. I look for patience, clear communication, and a curious mind. None of these I think are exclusive to software engineering.
